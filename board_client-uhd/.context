This is a python shim that allows the unicorn_wrangler micropython project to run on a raspberry pi with the pimoroni unicorn hd hat.

The idea is that only code necessary for compatability is in the project, and the versions from unicorn_wrangler are symbolically linked into the relevant places in this installation.

The unicorn hd hat is broadly the same as the stellar unicorn (16x16 led display array) which is why it is treated as such.
